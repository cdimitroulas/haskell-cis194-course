# haskell-cis194-course

I am following the [cis194 course for sprint 13](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html)
and completing the homework exercises in this repo.

I often look at [bschwb's](https://github.com/bschwb/cis194-solutions) or
[evansb's](https://github.com/evansb/cis194-hw) solutions when I get stuck or want to check if
there is a better way to solve the problems.


Please feel free to use my solutions to help yourself get through the exercises if you need!
